## Base dependencies

- [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authorization and deployment.
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) as icons package.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling HTML elements (reusable components).
- [react-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) for smooth scrolling between sections.

## Main Tools 

**ReactJS**

React JS is used for front-end development, making it easy to manage the various components of the interface and ensure a smooth user experience.


**UI/UX**

The **UX design** focuses on making the process of managing Ethereum transactions simple and intuitive for the user. A clean and modern layout, along with clear and concise text, makes it easy for users to navigate the interface and complete transactions with ease.

HTML provides the structure for the pages and components, while **Styled-components** enables the creation of customized and reusable styles for the interface.
 

**Firebase**

The ETH wallet project has authorization and deployment via **Firebase**, adding an additional layer of security and ease of use to the project. Firebase provides the necessary tools and infrastructure for deploying and hosting the wallet application, while also offering user authentication services to secure access to the wallet.

The **deployment** of the ETH wallet through Firebase streamlines the process, making it easier for users to access and use the wallet. The integration of Firebase into the ETH wallet project makes it a secure and scalable solution for managing Ethereum transactions.
